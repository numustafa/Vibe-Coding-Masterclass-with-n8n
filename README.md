# Vibe-Coding-Masterclass-with-n8n
This Repository contains my learning experience that I gained while attending in Berlin by [AICamp](https://www.aicamp.ai/event/eventdetails/W2025052709) "hands-on workshop for Vibe coding and n8n Masterclass". The idea is to build a smart chrome extension called Prompt Pilot for your Linkedin engagement. 

This extension leverages ChatGPT, n8n, and your personal writing style to help you engage more effectively on LinkedIn. With a single click, it reads the post you're viewing, takes your prompt, and generates a thoughtful comment in your voice, all within the LinkedIn comment box. 

This repo will contain my learnings in:
* JS
* Typescript
* Following the [Vibe coding session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtV893ZTcFQ&t=8s)
